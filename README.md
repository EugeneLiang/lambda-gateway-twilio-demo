#Lambda + API Gateway Example  

This example uses [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/) to send an image from your mobile phone to AWS S3. Users send images using MMS to a Twilio phone number and Twilio processes the image by hitting an API Gateway Endpoint that fires a Lambda function. The app then returns a publicly assessable link to the image in S3. This app uses AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB & S3 services. It is also severless!

## Usage 

Send an MMS to (650) 200 - 1944.
